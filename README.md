# Express Server for Chat Application with Socket.IO

This repository contains an Express server for a real-time chat application using Socket.IO. The server handles client connections, message broadcasting, and basic chat functionalities.

## Getting Started

To get the server up and running locally, follow these steps:

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KindrakevychNatali/chat-server.git
   cd repository-name
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Server

Start the server using the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The server will start on port 5000 by default. You can change this in the `server.js` file if needed.

### Server Structure

The server code is structured as follows:

- **`server.js`**: Main entry point of the server application.
- **`routes/`**: Contains route handlers for different API endpoints.
- **`utils/`**: Utility functions used throughout the server.
- **`sockets/`**: Manages Socket.IO connections and events.

### Socket.IO Integration

The server uses Socket.IO for real-time communication between clients. Socket.IO is integrated into the Express server to handle chat message broadcasting and user connections.

### API Endpoints

The server may include API endpoints for various functionalities related to the chat application, such as:

- `/api/messages`: Handles fetching and sending chat messages.
- `/api/users`: Manages user authentication or identification (if applicable).
- Other custom endpoints as needed for your application.

## Dependencies

- **Express**: Web framework for Node.js.
- **Socket.IO**: Real-time bidirectional event-based communication library.
- Other dependencies as defined in `package.json`.

## Contributing
